This is the basic app for a possible future personal home page and a business
page for a single user.

The app has two main functional aspects:
1. A personal home page with blog with comment system and post sorting by
tags. There are plans to also add a gallery system to link gallery objects
with blog posts. But also allow independent access to galleries.
2. Business home page section, planned to be mostly focusing on those very
same image galleries.

Current functionality:
1. login/logout for a single user.
2. blog post drafting/publishing/unpublishing/editing/deleting
3. Commenting for both logged in and anonymous users
4. tagging posts upon creation and when editing
5. basic page structure with httpResonses

Planned to implement:
1. Gallery system for personal home page. Linking galleries and images to
blog posts.
2. Bootstrap for UI/UX
3. Finalizing post tagging including allowing for no tags on post.
4. export post and comments  as pdf
5. comment moderation
6. form field size adjustment
7. post/comment author flare if post/comment author is logged in.
8. extending the app to be functional for any arbitrary number of users
9. fully working business page side
10. hosting app.
